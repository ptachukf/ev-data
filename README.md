# EV Popularity Analysis (based on Open EV Data)

This repository is a **fork of [Open EV Data](https://github.com/KilowattApp/open-ev-data)**, 
a dataset of electric vehicle specifications.  

The purpose of this fork is not to extend the dataset itself, but to **use it as a foundation 
for analyses of electric vehicle popularity worldwide**.

## Project goal

This repository is part of my bachelor thesis:  
**"Analysis of the popularity of electric cars worldwide using Wikipedia and other open data sources."**

Using Open EV Data as a reference for vehicle models, I will:

- Cross-reference EV models with Wikipedia pageviews and other open statistics,
- Explore trends in EV popularity across different regions,
- Present data visualizations and comparative statistics.

## Data sources

- **[Open EV Data](https://github.com/KilowattApp/open-ev-data)** – base dataset of EV specifications (MIT License with Attribution).
- **Wikipedia** (via [Wikimedia API](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Analytics/AQS/Pageviews)) – for pageview statistics.
- **Other open datasets** (market reports, government statistics, etc.) where available.

## Planned outputs

- Cleaned and merged datasets (CSV/XLSX) linking EV specs to popularity metrics,
- Jupyter notebooks with data analysis,
- Visualizations (plots, charts, maps) showing trends in EV adoption and interest.
