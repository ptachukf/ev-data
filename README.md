# EV Data (Fork of Open EV Data)

This repository is a fork of [Open EV Data](https://github.com/KilowattApp/open-ev-data), 
a comprehensive database of electric vehicle specifications focusing on charging capabilities 
and energy consumption. 

In this fork I am extending the dataset with **additional EV specifications** such as:

- Top speed (`top_speed_kmh`)
- Driving range by cycle (`range_wltp_km`, `range_epa_km`, `range_cltc_km`)
- Other technical details relevant for research and applications

The goal is to create a richer, more complete dataset for use in my bachelor thesis and 
potential EV-related projects.

## Current extensions

- Added new fields for EV performance specs (top speed, ranges).
- Work in progress: scripts for automated data extraction and enrichment.
- Plan: convert enriched data into convenient formats (CSV, XLSX, SQLite).
